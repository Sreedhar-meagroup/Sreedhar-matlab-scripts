%More or less unfinished work, The  idea was to look at Network burst
%interval distrubtions, Network burst length distribution, and finally the
%dependence on the Networkburst interval vs. the Networkburst length. I
%expected to see a dependence that goes exponentially, i.e longer Network
%bursts for longer intervals (before he NB). The ideas behind  that were
%taken from Staley et al 2001, J. Neurpphysiology. They study similar
%things (not in cultures however). They have the idea that burst timing can
%be explained by relaxation from depression. They set up a model where they
%can measure the relevant timeconstant of relaxation, and furthermore explain a
%burst-timing distribution by a binomial probability ditribution of
%relaxing synapses.
% I thought I can come up with a similar analysis, but I have seen that in many cases, I don't see a clear exponantial dependency between
% Networkburst interval and Network burst length. Only in a few cases I could imagine to fit an exponential in the curve. In many cases however, Network bursts
% had constant length, not dependend on the Interval before. In other cases
% there was just no clear sepearation possible. Maybe the analysis was not
% detailed enough.
% 
% Another observation was, sth. that also in the mentioned paper was studied, that there seems to be a clear relation between the mean and variance of burst lengths at INDIVIDUAL electrodes.
% I.e. I look at the distribution of burst lengths from several electrodes, calculate mean length and the variance, and see that for the whoel dataste, 
% I can fit the dependency of mean and variance approx like var = a*mean^3, i.e. a third order polynomial.
% The mentioned paper finds this relationship with Networkbursts of slices with different excitability (K_0+ - level), i.e. different burst levels.
