%This is a totally new written burst detection, to be conform with Samoras
%way of detecting bursts and setting the different requirement and
%conditions for a burst.
% The algorithm is much faster, because it works with almost no loops,
% except for the for channels.
%The conditions are:
%Minimal nr. of spikes in a burst;
%Maximal Interspike interval in a burst
%Maximal interval between two bursts
%
%What it does (for each channel) is basically the following:
%it searches in the spike train for ISI that are smaller tahn the condition and
%seraches for beginning and end of a 'potential'burst
%After that, it throws away all those potential starts and ends, where the
%gap between start and end is smaller than the Minimal Interval between
%burst. Then it discard sall those already 'detected' bursts. that have
%less than Minimal nr. of spikes in it. In the end, i get a vector tah t
%looks  e.g.like 001111000022220003333333300044444, thsi vector has the
%same length as the spiek train and each 0 means the resp spike does not
%belong to ao burst, every other value x means that spike belongs to burst
%nr. x. the vectors bursts_beg and bursts_end are vectores that contain the
%beginning and and ending spike nr. of each burst. With all that information,
% I can construct my cell burst detection in the same way, with the same
% entries sand information


%Used as a function:

%input:
%ls:            the usual structure with the spike information

% varargin        variable arguemnts, can be 
%                 MAX_INTERVAL_LENGTH, 
%                 MAX_BURST_INT or
%                 MIN_NO_SPIKES
% 

%output:        burst_detection, a cell with an entry for each channel,
                %where the information about every detected burst is stored
