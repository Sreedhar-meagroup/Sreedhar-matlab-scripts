function y=loadspike_sk(fn,range,freq)
% y=LOADSPIKE_SK(fn) loads spikes from given filename as a single chunk
% WITH CONTEXT into structure y with members
%   time    (1xN) (in samples)
%   channel (1xN)
%   height  (1xN)
%   width   (1xN)
%   context (124xN)
%   thresh  (1xN)
% where N is the total number of spikes detected.

% y=LOADSPIKE_SK(fn,range,freq_khz) converts times to seconds and width to
% milliseconds using the specified frequency, and the height and
% context data to microvolts by multiplying by RANGE/2048. Cut-outs are
% long (124 samples instead of the default 74)
% As a special case, range=0..3 is interpreted as a MultiChannel Systems 
% gain setting: (@SK: we use range=2, freq_khz = 25)
% 
% range value   electrode range (uV)    auxillary range (mV)
%      0               3410                 4092
%      1               1205                 1446
%      2                683                  819.6
%      3                341                  409.2
% 
% "electrode range" is applied to channels 0..59, auxillary range is
% applied to channels 60..63.
% In this case, the frequency is set to 25 kHz unless specified.

%31/10/06 (OW)
%the file loadspike was changed in order to be able to give  one, two
%or three parameters. each option imports and converts the data differently
%one parameter = only datname: no conversion of time and voltage
%two parameter = datname & gain: electrode voltage is transfered to uv
% three paramter = datname & gain & samplfreq: as with 2 para, but also % time is converted to seconds
%13/11/06 (OW)
%changed this file because from now on, Itry to record with longer cutouts,
%i.e 2 ms pre and 3 ms post. this was lready changed in the meabench
%package, now the according changes have to be made in the matlab files.
%what is recorde now are 50+74=124 values for the cutouts and the remaining
%8 values for the rest (height, width, time,...) this has to be changed
%here (124+8=132)
%worked with test spikes on dummy without problems. however, there is now
%more overload during an experiment (spikedet has to keep up with storing
%the cutouts) and it is not sure how this will affect the performance
