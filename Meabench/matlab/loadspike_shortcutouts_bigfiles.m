%meabench stores a spikeinfo as a 82-value long vector, each value is
%stored as a 2byte value. 
%See the script below for what each entry stands for (e.g. entries 8:81 are
%cutouts) Regarding cutouts, there ist still this odd thing that the
%stored digital values are relative to digital 2048 (what should be
%electrode voltag 0). But this is not that case for the spikeheight and
%threshold, so there the import from cutouts is not correct. this can be
%corrected for
%The import to matlab is done via this file where it is to consider that matlab uses 8byte values, i.e. 4 times the size.
%therefore matlab data files are bigger than the meabench raw (or rather spike) data



function [spike_info]=loadspike_shortcutouts_bigfiles(fn,range,freq)
% y=LOADSPIKE(fn) loads spikes from given filename into structure y
% with members
%   time    (1xN) (in samples)
%   channel (1xN)
%   height  (1xN)
%   width   (1xN)
%   context (75xN)
%   thresh  (1xN)
% y=LOADSPIKE(fn,range,freq_khz) converts times to seconds and width to
% milliseconds using the specified frequency, and the height and
% context data to microvolts by multiplying by RANGE/2048.
% As a special case, range=0..3 is interpreted as a MultiChannel Systems 
% gain setting:
% 
% range value   electrode range (uV)    auxillary range (mV)
%      0               3410                 4092
%      1               1205                 1446
%      2                683                  819.6
%      3                341                  409.2
% 
% "electrode range" is applied to channels 0..59, auxillary range is
% applied to channels 60..63.
% In this case, the frequency is set to 25 kHz unless specified.
